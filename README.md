**This module is very instable and should not be used**. It converts a peritext document to a static html and then convert it to another vernacular format using pandoc.

Requires pandoc installed on server.

Supports exports to :

* docx
* odt
* markdown
* latex
* rst
* icml (indesign) - not functional for now

See [Pandoc doc](http://pandoc.org/index.html) for other (theoretical, not yet tested) output possibilities.
